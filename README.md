# Battleship

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Battleship** game, built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

It is a project developed as part of the [JavaScript curriculum on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), focusing on DOM manipulation, modular JS, and game logic structuring.

## Features

- 2-player turn-based gameplay
- Ship placement with orientation controls
- Visual feedback for ship hits and misses
- Modular structure using JavaScript classes and factory functions
- Basic styling for usability and board clarity

## Still to come (maybe..)

- Play against a computer opponent (AI)
- Sound effects and animations
- Victory screen and replay button
- Improved UI/UX polish
